# Acoustic-Neutrino-Detection
Master thesis project on determining the sensitivity of a potential acoustic neutrino detector. The tital of the project is *Determining the Sensitivity of a Future Acoustic Neutrino Telescope*.

This Git is catagorised by chapter in the thesis. Thus, the code used to create a figure in the thesis is listed under the folder of the name of the respective chapter. Within the folders there is a README file explaining each of the individual files in the folder and what they have been used for. Besides the chapter, there are three additional folders named *Appendix*, *EXTRA*, and *Event Detection Algorithm*. The first is a folder in which the code used to make the images in the Appendix is stored, similarly to the individual chapters. The second, *EXTRA*, is storing all the unnused notebooks and files that have been made in the duration of this project and might potentially still have some use to them. The *Event Detection Algorithm* folder stores the Montecarlo code as slightly adapted from [1]. It is included in the Git for completeness sake.
