# H. The Acoustic Positioning System in KM3NeT

The figures in this Appendix of the thesis are made with the code files in this folder.
* Figure 72, 74-75: *MAARTEN_ARCA_data_file.ipynb*
* Figure 73: *ARCA_data_file.ipynb*

The *ARCA DIVE.txt* file shows the measured sound speeds at the ARCA site resulting from a dive performed in 2016. 

The *Chen & Millero.ipynb* notebook looks a bit more at the parametrisation of these authors and compares it to the data from the dive file.

Note: for Figures 72, 74, and 75 the data files *ARCA_1541.0_17e-3_2000_slides.txt*, *ARCA_1541.0_17e-3_2000_slides_Delgrosso.txt*, and *ARCA_1541.0_17e-3_2000_slides_+0.1.txt* were used respectively.
