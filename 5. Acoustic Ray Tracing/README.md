# 5. Acoustic Ray Tracing

The figures in the fourth chapter of the thesis are made with the code files in this folder.
* Figure 29, 31-41: *PYLOS_results10kHz.ipynb* & *TANGANYIKA_results10kHz.ipynb* (using data files: *PYLOShitdatarandom_10kHz.txt* & *TANGANYIKAhitdatarandom_10kHz.txt*)
* Figure 30: **

* Figure 44: **

The data files used to make the above figures were created by the following code files also included in this folder.
* PYLOShitdatarandom_10kHz.txt & TANGANYIKAhitdatarandom_10kHz.txt: *PYLOS_data_file.ipynb* & *TANGANYIKA_data_file.ipynb*

Note: The above notebooks all need to run within the Bellhop program. Simply copy and paste them into the same folder in which the bellhop.exe file is located and you will be able to run them. To get a better overview of how to download Bellhop, a word file called *Bellhop Installation Guides* including some references is added to this folder.
