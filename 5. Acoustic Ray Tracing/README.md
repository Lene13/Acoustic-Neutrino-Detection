# 5. Acoustic Ray Tracing

The figures in the fifth chapter of the thesis are made with the code files in this folder.
* Figure 29, 31-41, 44: *PYLOS_results10kHz.ipynb* & *TANGANYIKA_results10kHz.ipynb* (using data files: *PYLOShitdatarandom_10kHz.txt* & *TANGANYIKAhitdatarandom_10kHz(_1&_2).txt*)
* Figure 30: *TANGANYIKA.ipynb*
* Figure 42 left: *Neutrino Signal.ipybn*
* Figure 42 right: *Absorption Coefficient.ipynb* (can be found in 4. Site Selection and Water Parameters)
* Figure 43: *PYLOS_topology_right_TL.ipynb* & *TANGANYIKA_topology_right_TL.ipynb*

The data files used to make the above figures were created by the following code files also included in this folder.
* PYLOShitdatarandom_10kHz.txt: *PYLOS_data_file.ipynb*
* TANGANYIKAhitdatarandom_10kHz(_1&_2).txt: *TANGANYIKA_data_file.ipynb*

Note: The above notebooks all need to run within the Bellhop program. Simply copy and paste them into the same folder in which the bellhop.exe file is located and you will be able to run them. To get a better overview of how to download Bellhop, a word file called *Bellhop Installation Guides* including some references is added to this folder. I have also included the manual from Porter as *Bellhop3D User Guide 2016_7_25.pdf*[1] and some others *HLS-2010-1.pdf*[2], *HLS-2021-01.pdf*[3].

Also note: TANGANYIKAhitdatarandom_10kHz_1 and TANGANYIKAhitdatarandom_10kHz_2 are supposed to be together in one file but this file succeeded the uploadable file size so they were split up.
