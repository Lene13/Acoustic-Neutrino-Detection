# Extra

In this folder I have stored all my miscellaneous notebooks and bits of codes. They are ordered in a broad manner. The Bellhop folder represents notebooks and text files that were used within the Bellhop environment. The Matlab folder stores matlab codes together with Python codes that can model acoustic pulses and are meant to get a feeling of the subject. The Kevin folder stores all the Monte Carlo code as used in this research, which was developed by [1]. The code is mostly similar to the one presented in https://github.com/Kevinvo97/Hydrophones/tree/main, but some of the HMain files are adapted to suit specific causes.
