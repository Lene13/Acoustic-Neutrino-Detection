# HMain Files

In this folder the HMain files can be found together with their .sh bash script that can run them on a server. Naturally, the .sh file with the same name as the .py file will run that respective file. Also, when importing this code, keep in mind a file containing all python packages used should be present on the server within a folder called *Thoth*.
