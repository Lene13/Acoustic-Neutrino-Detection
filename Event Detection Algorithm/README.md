# Event Detection Algorithm

In this folder all the components of the event detection algorithm developed by [1] are presented as they were used in this work. They might include small adaptations and for completeness sake have been included. For the original code one can take a look at https://github.com/Kevinvo97/Hydrophones/blob/main/acou5.py.

The H files in this folder all linked together in the HMain files which can naturally be found in the *HMain Files* folder above. Each of them had their own use, which is further explained in the README file in that folder.
