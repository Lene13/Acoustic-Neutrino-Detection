# 8. Sensitivity

The figures in the seventh chapter of the thesis are made with the code files in this folder.
* Figure 53-54: *Pandepth paper NMin=20.ipynb*
* FIgure 55: *Pandepth paper NMin=20 Comparison.ipynb*

Note: The above file uses the effective volumes that were calculated with *Effective Volume Pylos (NMin Comparison).ipynb* and *Effective Volume Tanganyika (NMin Comparison).ipynb* from chapter 6.

In the thesis only the sensitivities with PanDepth are shown. The notebooks below have plotted other scenarios:
* *Final Sensitivity Normal.ipynb*: the effective volume without the PanDepth and one detector block.
* *Final Sensitivity PanDepth.ipynb*: the effective volume with the PanDepth and one detector block. Another comparison.
* *Final Sensitivity Comparison.ipynb*: the effective volume with and without the PanDepth and ten detector blocks.
